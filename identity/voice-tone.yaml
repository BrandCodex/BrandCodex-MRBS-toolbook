    use_for:
      - "MRBS specification"
      - "API documentation"
      - "Schema references"
      - "Integration guides"
    characteristics:
      - "Precise"

      - "Comprehensive"
      - "Neutral"
    rules:
      contractions: false

      rhetorical_questions: false
      code_examples: "required_where_relevant"
      sentence_length: "varied, clarity over brevity"
    vocabulary:
      use:
        - "MUST, SHOULD, MAY" (RFC 2119 keywords where appropriate)
        - "Specifies", "defines", "requires"
        - Technical terms with definitions on first use
      avoid:
        - "Simply", "just", "easy" (dismissive)
        - "Obviously", "clearly" (assumes knowledge)
        - Marketing language
    examples:
      good: |
        The `brand.manifest.json` file MUST be located at the root of the brand system directory.
        This file serves as the entry point for AI agents and contains paths to all components.
      bad: |
        Just drop the manifest.json in your folder and you're good to go!
        It's super easy to set up.

  educational_content:
    description: "Helpful, encouraging, progressive"
    use_for:
      - "Getting started guides"
      - "Tutorials"
      - "Blog posts about concepts"
      - "Migration guides"
    characteristics:
      - "Supportive"
      - "Step-by-step"
      - "Encouraging"
      - "Clear"
    rules:

    vocabulary:
      use:
        - "You'll", "Let's", "Here's how"
        - "Think of it like..."
        - "The key insight is..."
      avoid:
        - Assuming prior knowledge without explanation
        - Overwhelming with options before basics
        - "As you probably know..." (maybe they don't)
    examples:
      good: |
        Let's start with the most important file in any MRBS system: the manifest.
        Think of it as the table of contents—it tells AI agents where to find everything.
        
        Here's the simplest possible manifest:
        ```json
        {
          "mrbs_version": "1.0.0",
          "brand": { "name": "Your Brand" }
        }
        ```
      bad: |
        Obviously, you need to create your manifest first. 
        The schema is self-explanatory, so just follow the patterns.

        - "Best-in-class", "world-class", "leading"
        - Empty superlatives
    examples:
      good: |
        Your brand guidelines are trapped in a PDF.

        that AI agents can interpret and apply—automatically.
